# ContactAngle-


The Python script determined the contact angle by calculating the angle formed in between the surface and droplet. The script will first determine the edge of the droplet by using the feature.canny. Later, the droplet and the surface were determined and fitted into the circle/ellipse and linear equation. Lastly, the angle between the circle/ellipse and the linear equation is determined by using trigonometry.  

Two folders are needed to be created with label as rawdata and processdata. Place the imaged which are intended to be process into the rawdata folder and leave the process data empty. Place the both script outside of both folders. Run "CAanalysis' script first, follow by the 'run' script.
