# ContactAngle-


The Python script determined the contact angle by calculating the angle formed in between the surface and droplet. The script will first determine the edge of the droplet by using the feature.canny. Later, the droplet and the surface were determined and fitted into the circle/ellipse and linear equation. Lastly, the angle between the circle/ellipse and the linear equation is determined by using trigonometry.
